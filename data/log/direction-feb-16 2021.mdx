- I type in my "thought dump" section mainly because it lowers the pressure of writing, or of putting ideas down in the right category. still, I dread the idea of actually organizing these thought dumps, wonder if there's something to dissect there. It's not because of the writing being cringe (although it is), I mainly think it's due to most of my thoughts being ephemeral. I have a seemingly random topic that come to my mind, proceed to do a lil walk amongst ideas, and nothing necessarily comes of it. not saying all thoughts should lead to something productive, but outside of daily time I set aside to think, I feel as though don't .
- if all of this sounds a bit trite, I agree with you. it's one of those things where awareness of the problem still doesn't lead to a satisfying solution. I could, but probably won't, just spend all my time thinking about thinking, and being more deliberate about what I do. Frankly, that sounds exhausting, so I'm more curious about what low hanging fruit I might be missing, if there are any to be found.
- perhaps this is where the power of routines and goal setting would really shine, but I'm worried i'll just standardize my life away, if that makes sense.being off by 1 degree now could have me end up a mile away from where I want to be in the future. even pilots are (apparently) within an error range of 2 degrees when they make their turns, so I just need to be in the neighbourhood of where I'd like to be. that end goal still hasn't crystallized itself to me yet. all in all, not the worst problem to have in the world, but there's still more to figure out.

# Ideas

- so far I've been brainstorming ideas primarily pertaining to "problem solving", getting rid of pains, reducing steps to achieve x, etc. I haven't been thinking as much about products that bring "joy". Now, that's a bit vague, and I'm not sure if I'm fully sold on the idea that products + consumption themselves are what'll bring joy. so, this has me curious about the contexts in which it would.
- if I lived in the middle of texas in a time before fans or a/c, I am certain I would be overjoyed to get my hands on some sort of cooling device soon as it's invented. perhaps the potency of the problem? however that still feels unclear to me.
