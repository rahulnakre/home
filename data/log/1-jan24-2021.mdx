- GANs are really annoying to train
- Fargo is a great show
- what needs to be simplified?
- there's so much data, so much to get distracted by, we need some focus
- however we'd still want to retain the plus side to all this new data: the key insights it brings
- I feel like rec engines haven't fully been explored in this use case, our data is behind a wall for someone else to suggest you things, but its not so easy to levarage its data for your own gain
- there r still annoying problems w scaling that don't need to be there
- also I like the observation that many devs (me included), overcomplicate their blogs for no reason
