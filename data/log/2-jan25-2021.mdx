- No joke I would use this
- Setup up env vars on their platform, and run you program like `doppler run npm run dev`, 
  pick your project, and your variables are added to the env
- no need for .env files and `process.env` stuff
- I wonder why (to my knowledge), this hasn't been done like this before
- In hindsight it seems obvious, but it's reall cool. Simplifies the clunky flow of creating envs,
  sharing it on some messaging platform, deleting it from there, only for it to happen again when new
  variables need to inevitably be added
- For now I'm still using bullet points to write these cus normal text styles weird here.
